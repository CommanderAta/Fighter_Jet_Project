## Introduction
The Fighter Jet Project is a comprehensive simulation application developed in Java, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project aims to model the operational dynamics of a fighter jet, including flight mechanics, weapon systems, and environmental interactions, to provide a realistic and educative tool for understanding the complexities of modern air combat vehicles.

## Features
- **Flight Simulation:** Realistic modeling of flight dynamics, allowing users to control the jet's pitch, yaw, and roll.
- **Weapon Systems:** Implementation of various weapon systems, including missiles, machine guns, and countermeasures.
- **Environmental Effects:** Simulation of weather conditions and their impact on flight dynamics and weapon efficacy.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** An intuitive GUI for controlling the jet and visualizing flight data.
- **OOP Design:** Utilization of OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction for modular and maintainable code.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Any IDE that supports Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Ensure the JDK is correctly set up in your project settings.
4. Build the project to resolve dependencies.

## Usage
To run the simulation, navigate to the main class in your IDE and run the application. The GUI will launch, presenting you with controls for the fighter jet and options to simulate different scenarios.

## Code Examples
Example of a FighterJet class utilizing OOP principles:

```java
public abstract class FighterJet {
    protected String model;
    protected double maxSpeed;
    protected WeaponSystem weaponSystem;

    public FighterJet(String model, double maxSpeed) {
        this.model = model;
        this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;
        this.weaponSystem = new WeaponSystem();
    }

    public abstract void fly();

    public void fireWeapon() {
        weaponSystem.activate();
    }
}

class F16 extends FighterJet {
    public F16() {
        super("F16", 1500);
    }

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("F16 is flying at speed: " + maxSpeed);
    }
}
```
